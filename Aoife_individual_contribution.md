To upload a scraped dataset into Python, you can use a variety of libraries such as Pandas or BeautifulSoup. Once you have imported the dataset, you can begin working on it to establish questions such as the highest price rent and the address that has the highest rent.

To determine the highest price rent, you can use the Pandas library to sort the dataset by the price column and select the highest value. To find the address with the highest rent, you can use the same method to sort the dataset by the rent column and then locate the corresponding address value.

After obtaining this information, you can perform data analysis on the information in the form of graphs using libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn. For example, you can create a bar graph to visualize the distribution of rental prices in the dataset or a scatter plot to examine the relationship between rental price and location. These graphs can help to identify trends and patterns in the data and provide insights that can inform future decisions.

I had to work in collaboration with Vivien and Arkam in my group, this was crucial in order to have a seamless flow of the web scraping, data preparation and variable selection sections into the question answering section. This goes hand in hand with each other. I havenâ€™t had much experience doing group assignments, but this has been a positive experience, learning from each other has been helpful too. 

Living in Dublin at the time of a housing crisis has made this a particularly interesting dataset to explore. In reflection of this exercise identifying the spike in rent prices of rent in Dublin stands out, this sparked my interest in this area of research.

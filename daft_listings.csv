Will start replying around the 8th of April, viewings on the 16th-17th April (Sunday). Thanks! :) *

Hey guys,

beautiful and cozy en-suite large double room with lots of storage coming free in April. In a quiet house sharing with a professional couple in their mid 30s and our adorable kitten Keeba! 

Your room is quiet and peaceful, blackout blinds, no neighbour beside you, quiet solo old neighbour in the house below. Siesta city! Also have a smart TV connected to netflix and amazon prime, same in the sitting room and we also have one in our room so you'll often have the sitting room to yourself. 

We can read the room and understand that sometimes you might want a chat, sometimes a glass of wine, or sometimes just leave you be to cook or exist in peace, and we totally get that and are the same. We don't hog the sitting room, we aren't super annoying clingy couple and we are very much two individual people so I can honestly say, it's a good dynamic.

House life - noise and bad sleeps, the worst so we tend not to make noise after 11pm or before 7.30am Monday - Fri so someone on similar shift patterns who values their sleep and downtime might prefer this.

We don't throw parties or invite randoms back, we still go out for a few but we just don't bring home the craic with us. That time for us is over, we want a nice predictable comfortable place so just mentioning that for people who want this style of home!

There is free parking and free bins, clothes line in a communal garden area. Shed for our bikes and camping bits or whatever. Sun hits it in the summer, its nice and relatively private. Also have a third room in the house that I pay for extra, I wont rent it but use it for clothes horses/extra storage so feel free to put some stuff in there or dry clothes in there etc.

Bills -
Wifi superfast sky fibre is 10 euro p/m
Parking/bins free
Netflix/Amazon prime free
Electricity - every 2 months, could be 80, could be 100, you know yourselves :D

Nothing else really, there is a new bar and shop being built right around the corner, there is a bus service but honestly its a bit crap so would recommend drivers. Barna woods is 5 minutes away due to side access. Oh and obviously if you have cat allergies, it's probably not a good idea!",03/04/2023,"1,678"

"14 Lohunda Crescent, Clonsilla, Dublin 15",€175 per week,Single Room,Shared Bathroom,House,1,Immediately,4 Months,1,Yes,Male / Female,"DescriptionPLEASE READ THE VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS ADVERTISEMENT AS IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. WHEN YOU READ IT AND IF IT DOES NOT SUIT YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE IS NO POINT IN GETTING IN TOUCH BECAUSE IT WON'T EVER CHANGE. SO PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING. 

This house is not available from Friday evening at 6 pm to Sunday evening at 6 pm. This forms part of the contract. The price of E175 is this good (when everything is so expensive for everyone e.g. a warm house is almost priceless) purely because it is for a 5 day week only. It is a place to stay midweek while in Dublin and for you to go back home at the weekends. This is not negotiable. It is the reason it is as cheap as it is, with bills included in the price, meaning there is nothing else to pay for. It would be most suitable for a student that goes home at the weekend to their original town where their parents are or for people who work in Dublin midweek and then go home to their family at the weekend.
                                                                            
It is a very warm cozy house with new double glazed windows and a new front door. The room includes a new double bed with a very comfortable mattress. Sheets, duvets, pillows, and all bed clothing supplied. New sheets, duvet covers and pillow cases can be seen still in their wrapping paper if requested.  

It has a double bed, desk, swivel chair, and storage for files/books/magazines. It has a wardrobe for clothes and a large footstool pouf for shoe storage, plus it has a TV with Netflix. 

All utility bills are included in the rent price. And of course toilet paper, soap and washing-up liquid is there for everyone's use. That's about having everyone equipped so as to ensure they live in a hygienic house. 

The likes of coffee, tea, milk, fruit, toothpaste, shower gel, shampoo, and alcohol are not included. Think ""Would I like it if anything I had worked for and paid for was taken and used by someone else in your house?""
 
You have all the facilities to cook for yourself, i.e. woks, pots, oven trays, and microwave plus you have a dishwasher for cleaning up afterward. You will be given your own shelf for storage of your own food. And some space in the fridge and freezer too. 

It is a quiet house in a nice area, so it will also help as a place to study or relax in the evenings or on evening walks. 

There are many local gyms but I know of one that allows you to pay as you go. Maybe others do this too but I haven't heard of it. I think it's there to help young people to be able to afford to go to it. It has a modern kitted-out gym, plus a swimming pool, sauna and jacuzzi. There are classes you have to pay for also. The staff are always helpful so I can recommend it. The pay-as-you-go is a very handy option but I think you can pay for a week too. You'd have to check it out for yourself. I am not affiliated with it in any way.

It is within walking distance of Blanchardstown Shopping Center. There are many local parks that are very nice, especially Porterstown, Shackleton Gardens and The Phoenix Park. 

The house is kept very hygienically clean. Everywhere is cleaned every day, especially washing floors, bathroom and kitchen counters, and taps, however you do have to clean up after your own self and think about how hygienically you are leaving the place or other items for other people in the house, e.g. the shower when all the water has gone or the chopping board used for your sandwich or dinner's ingredients. We all just wipe it down the places we dirty with the anti-bacterial household wipes supplied and that keeps everyone healthy. 

The room is a cornflower blue shade. The bedroom gets beautiful sunlight in the afternoon. The living room has very warm colours and has a nice comfy couch that can be used to relax.  You also have a modern kitchen for making and eating meals. Off the kitchen is a sunroom with a couch and small tv.

There is a nice garden and there are chairs under the gazebo if you wanted to sit outdoors with a lap blanket and hot water bottle (you can borrow) and a hot drink or vape. Or when the weather improves you could sit out anywhere with a book and a glass of wine/beer.

I have two gorgeous friendly and funny Shih Tzus. They love meeting and being with people. And they are caring and well-trained. There is a good age gap, but they love each other and play a lot. They always give you a laugh.

The 39 and 39A bus stop is practically outside the door. You would be at it in 2 minutes. This bus goes all the way over to UCD after a stop on the North Quays near O'Connell Bridge and another at TCD. 

This is the timetable for the 39 which has more stops: https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-line-39-Ireland-502-5846-228587-1

This is the timetable for the 39A which runs all  day and night and has fewer stops. https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-line-39A-Ireland-502-5846-228656-0#:~:text=39A%20bus%20operates%2024%20hours%2C%207%20days%20a%20week.,-Day

Within a 10 walking distance you have the L52 which goes through Lucan village.
 https://citymapper.com/dublin/bus/bus-l52

Within a 10 minute walking distance there is the stop for the 139 that brings you to TU Blanchardstown in one direction and Leixlip in the other direction. It starts at 7.30 am and ends at 10.30 pm.  https://moovitapp.com/ireland-502/lines/139/707776/6013205/en?ref=1&poiType=stop&abTest=Test_From_List_to_Plain_Text&customerId=4908&af_sub8=%2Findex%2Fen%2Fpublic_transit-Mountview_Road-Ireland-stop_2052294-502&sid=35400810&sidx=0


Your nearest train station in Clonsilla going into Connolly Station (with various stops including Broom Bridge Station where you can change to other lines) is a 15-minute walk. It also goes out to Maynooth. The station is only 15 minutes away. 

There are also separate buses going to TUI Blanchardstown Campus which are a 10-minute walk away. I have been told by a student that its their own dedicated bus but you'd have to check it out with the college to be 100% sure.

N.B. I will be there all day every day. I will need silence to think properly, from 9 am to 5 pm. It's very important that my concentration is not distracted by any loud music or loud conversations. Normal level conversations are fine and so is a low radio. But not shouting or high-pitched music. I  just cannot be disturbed during those times. And the other person in the house works early shifts so they have to be able to sleep a couple of hours in the afternoon without any noise at all. It would be similar to them turning up the volume of everything they are doing when they get up for the start of their day and neglecting that the other people would be still getting their night-time sleep. If you work shifts, then thought will be given to your circumstances for when you need to get your sleep. Again common sense and us all respecting each other means a happy house for everyone.

Seeing as we generally receive quite a high volume of enquiries on these ads, in order to increase your chances please include as much information about yourself as possible when making the enquiry. All enquiries will be read, and a fair decision will be made as to who will be getting a viewing.]

A private double room to rent in Clontarf.

We are four young working professionals looking for a fifth tenant to share this modern & beautiful house with an ocean view. The house is located just next to the Bull Island bridge, and is only a short walk away from Saint Anne's Park and nearby stores.

We've got a large, spacious kitchen, roof terrace, garden & patio. There is currently no parking available on the property.

You will be sharing the bathroom with only one other tenant. The room is located at the rear of the house, and while you are isolated from most road noise, for the sake of transparency there are a few things to keep in mind with regards to noise. There is a pump located next to the room which will make noises between 08:00 and 23:00 when water is used in the house. You may also be subject to some noise from the kitchen area which is located above, and there may also be some noise passing through from the next-door bedroom as the walls are relatively thin. Just something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to sounds.

The monthly rent for the room (see pictures) is 800 euros, with a one month up-front deposit. Bills are not included, but roughly add up to 30 euros for electricity, 100 euros for gas paid bi-monthly. Bins are not included and cost 4/5 euros a month. Internet is 10 euros a month. So in total you could expect to pay about 80 euros in bills per month (Subject to change). In addition, we all also chip in on more communal items such as dish soap, kitchen rolls, cleaning products etc. It would also be appreciated if you could do your part to help keep the house in a clean and tidy condition.

 We require at least one reference from a previous landlord.

At the point of moving in, you will be sharing the house with three men as well as one Irish woman. The remaining men are of Norwegian, Italian and Irish. Ideally we are looking for a second woman to add to the balance of the household - someone who is friendly and sociable. We do not throw regular parties at the house, but on occasion might have smaller get-togethers with some music and drinks. In any case, we do respect each others privacy and boundaries and it would be appreciated if you do the same.

We are happy to welcome guests to the house, but please respect that you are sharing a house with four other people, and don't make it a daily occurrence. If you are planning on having guests over for a longer period of time, then this needs to be agreed upon between the housemates beforehand.

If we feel you are a good fit for the house we will reach out and offer you a viewing and a chance to see the house and get to know us better. Due to previous occurrences there will be no open viewings, and we will not accommodate viewings upon request - so please do not ask.

Lastly, please respect our privacy and do not show up at our door unsolicited.",10/04/2023,"2,221"

Hi all,

I have a lovely new semi-detached house in a picturesque street in Balgriffin, with rooms to rent :)

The house is about a 15min walk from Clongriffin DART station and Clarehall shopping centre, and about 30-40min walk from the seaside! Buses on the nearby streets run all night and Father Collins Park is just nearby. The house is only 4 years old so it's in new condition and very clean with a nice garden, shared kitchen and living room with fast internet and loads of TV channels!

It's really important to me that we find a home environment that's great for everyone. I've been a tenant in other people's houses for years and I got sick of all the fake ads and awful landlords and tiny dirty rooms... so I aim to make sure this will be as much of a friendly, hassle-free and relaxed environment as possible - somewhere you'll be happy to call home! Would it be too much to call it an oasis? :p

This is a really big house with lots of space. There are 3 bathrooms in total.

In your message, please tell me a bit about yourself and what you're looking for in a house :)

Thanks and I look forward to meeting you!
